	 * A class that creates, stores and provides access to all instances of PcapRemoteDevice for a certain remote machine. To get an instance
	 * of this class use one of the static methods of getRemoteDeviceList(). These methods creates a PcapRemoteDeviceList instance for the
	 * certain remote machine which holds a list of PcapRemoteDevice instances, one for each remote network interface. Note there is
	 * not a public constructor for this class, so the only way to get an instance of it is through getRemoteDeviceList(). After getting
	 * this object, this class provides ways to access the PcapRemoteDevice instances: either through IP address of the remote network interface or
	 * by iterating the PcapRemoteDevice instances (through the PcapRemoteDeviceList#RemoteDeviceListIterator iterator)<BR>
	 * Since Remote Capture is supported in WinPcap and Npcap only, this class is available in Windows only
